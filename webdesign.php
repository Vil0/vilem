			<h3>What I do:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span>HTML, PHP and jQuery development</span> - I always try to use the latest features and try to take full advantage of those languages. Even though I haven't fully mastered PHP and jQuery 					yet, I've never had an unbeatable trouble while writing code.</li>
				<li><span>CSS 3</span> - I style websites predominantly by means of CSS. I use core images only for logos and tailor-made graphics.</li>
				<li><span>Best suits me</span> - websites for groups of people with common interest, individuals with certain message to the world, musicians, ... I think you get me. No eshops and stuff like 						that.</li>
